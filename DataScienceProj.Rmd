## Traffic Fatalities Analysis Progress

+ Downloaded all 26 Datasets 
  - Ex: Accident, Distract, Paperwork, Person, Vehicle, etc.   
+ Narrowed down Research Questions of Interest 
  - 1. What model could be developed to identify communities that might be at risk fo fatal crashes?
  - 2. What are the characteristics of communities that in recent years have had the least risk?
  - 2. How does risk based on accident type differ geographically?  Is this risk consistent with previous years? 
+ Started Creating Codebook 
+ Determing Additional Variables to Create in Dataset
  - Was there increased driving in particular town/city, county, state, region? If so, why? How to code this?
  - Was there an increased amount of provisional licesnses issued in an given area?
