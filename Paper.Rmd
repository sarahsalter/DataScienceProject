#I.  Introduction


#II.  Methods

##A.  Data
```
The majority of the data used in this analysis was obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System (FARS), created by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The purpose 
of FARS was to provide an overall measure of highway safety, to help suggest solutions, and to help 
provide an objective basis to evaluate the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and 
highway safety programs.

FARS contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway 
customarily open to the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a 
non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash. FARS has been operational since 1975 and has collected 
information on over 989,451 motor vehicle fatalities and collects information on over 100 different 
coded data elements that characterizes the crash, the vehicle, and the people involved.

#IV.  Discussion 

FARS is vital to the mission of NHTSA to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes and deaths on our 
nation's highways, and subsequently, reduce the associated economic loss to society resulting from 
those motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. FARS data is critical to understanding the characteristics
of the environment, trafficway, vehicles, and persons involved in the crash.
